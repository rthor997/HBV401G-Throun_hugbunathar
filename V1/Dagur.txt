2. As a customer, I want to see reviews of the food available at the hotel I will be staying at, so I can know in advance whether I want to eat there.

3. As a customer, I want to be able to see previous bookings I have made, so that I can consider them for future stays.

4. As a customer, I want to be able to filter hotel searches by location, so I can stay in the area I want.

5. As a customer, I want to be able to filter hotel searches by popularity, because I trust popular opinion to find quality hotels.
