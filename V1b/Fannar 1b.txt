1. 20, A good amount of work would be needed to ensure the search/filter system works good and is seamless 

2. 5, would not be too hard, files would have to be formatted and stored correctly

3. 2, could have a template that is filled with the information of the booking and sent via email

4. 1/2, could be implemented as a tag in the Database

5. 8, Rooms would have to be available/unavailable if others have booked those days or have reserved those rooms

6. 3, it would have to show all booked rooms individualy 

7. 1/2, just display the tag of rooms present in the DB

8. 2, have a tag in booking DB for late checkout (might cause problems)

9. 13, would need separate DB for reviews and or use an API from something like Google or Tripadvisor

10. 3, display previous bookings matching the customers Email or unique ID

11. 3, have a tag that removes rooms from available to reserved, not quite to booked

12. 1, should not take long if rooms are tagged correctly in the database and conflicts are handled correctly
